## Overview

The classification of MHWs under the naming scheme first proposed by Hobday et al. (2018) may also be calculated and visualised with the __`heatwaveR`__ package using the `category()` function on the output of the `detect_event()` function. Note that one may control the output for the names of the events by providing ones own character string for the `name` argument. Because we have calculated MHWs on the Western Australia data, we provide the name "WA" below.

```{r category-example1}
# Load libraries
library(heatwaveR)
library(dplyr)

# Calculate events
ts <- ts2clm(sst_WA, climatologyPeriod = c("1983-01-01", "2012-12-31"))
mhw <- detect_event(ts)

# Look at the top few events
tail(category(mhw, S = TRUE, name = "WA"))
```

Note that this functions expects the data to have been collected in the southern hemisphere, hence the argument `S = TRUE`. If they were not, one must set `S = FALSE` as seen in the example below. This ensures that the correct seasons are attributed to the event.

```{r category-example2}
res_Med <- detect_event(ts2clm(sst_Med, climatologyPeriod = c("1983-01-01", "2012-12-31")))
tail(category(res_Med, S = FALSE, name = "Med"))
```

A quick and easy visualisation of the categories of a MHW may be accomplished with `event_line()` by setting the `category` argument to `TRUE`.

```{r fig-example-10, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
event_line(mhw, spread = 100, start_date = "2010-11-01", end_date = "2011-06-30", category = TRUE)
```

Were one to want to visualise the categories of a MHW 'by hand', the following code will provide a good starting point.

```{r fig-example-11, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Create category breaks and select slice of data.frame
clim_cat <- mhw$clim %>%
  dplyr::mutate(diff = thresh - seas,
                thresh_2x = thresh + diff,
                thresh_3x = thresh_2x + diff,
                thresh_4x = thresh_3x + diff) %>% 
  dplyr::slice(10580:10690)

# Set line colours
lineColCat <- c(
  "Temperature" = "black",
  "Climatology" = "gray20",
  "Threshold" = "darkgreen",
  "2x Threshold" = "darkgreen",
  "3x Threshold" = "darkgreen",
  "4x Threshold" = "darkgreen"
  )

# Set category fill colours
fillColCat <- c(
  "Moderate" = "#ffc866",
  "Strong" = "#ff6900",
  "Severe" = "#9e0000",
  "Extreme" = "#2d0000"
  )

ggplot(data = clim_cat, aes(x = t, y = temp)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y2 = thresh, fill = "Moderate")) +
  geom_flame(aes(y2 = thresh_2x, fill = "Strong")) +
  geom_flame(aes(y2 = thresh_3x, fill = "Severe")) +
  geom_flame(aes(y2 = thresh_4x, fill = "Extreme")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh_2x, col = "2x Threshold"), size = 0.7, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh_3x, col = "3x Threshold"), size = 0.7, linetype = "dotdash") +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh_4x, col = "4x Threshold"), size = 0.7, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_line(aes(y = seas, col = "Climatology"), size = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh, col = "Threshold"), size = 0.7) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, col = "Temperature"), size = 0.6) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = NULL, values = lineColCat,
                      breaks = c("Temperature", "Climatology", "Threshold",
                                 "2x Threshold", "3x Threshold", "4x Threshold")) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = NULL, values = fillColCat, guide = FALSE) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = c("solid", "solid", "solid",
                                                                "dashed", "dotdash", "dotted")))) + 
  labs(y = expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")), x = NULL)
```

Presently the functionality for the detection of categories for MCSs has not been introduced into __`heatwaveR`__, but it is inbound.
