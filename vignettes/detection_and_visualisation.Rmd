## Overview

The `detect_event()` function is the package's core function. Here is the `detect_event()` function applied to the Western Australian test data, which are also discussed by Hobday et al. (2016):

```{r detect-example1}
# Load libraries
library(heatwaveR)
library(dplyr)

# Detect the events in a time series
ts <- ts2clm(sst_WA, climatologyPeriod = c("1983-01-01", "2012-12-31"))
mhw <- detect_event(ts)

# View just a few metrics
mhw$event %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(event_no, duration, date_start, date_peak, intensity_mean, intensity_max, intensity_cumulative) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(-intensity_cumulative) %>% 
  head(5)
```

The corresponding `event_line()` and `lolli_plot()`, which represent the massive Western Australian heatwave of 2011, look like this:

```{r fig-example1, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
event_line(mhw, spread = 100, metric = "intensity_cumulative", start_date = "2010-11-01", end_date = "2011-06-30")
```

```{r fig-example2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
lolli_plot(mhw)
```

<!-- ![](vignettes/fig-example2-1.png) -->

The `event_line()` and `lolli_plot()` functions were designed to work directly on one of the dataframes in the list returned by `detect_event()`. If more control over the figures is required, it may be useful to create them in **`ggplot2`** by stacking `geoms`. We specifically created two new **`ggplot2`** `geoms` to reproduce the functionality of `event_line()` and `lolli_plot()`. These functions are more general in their functionality and can be used outside of the **`heatwaveR`** package, too. To apply them to MHWs and MCSs first requires that we access the `clim` or `event` dataframes within the list that is produced by `detect_event()`. Here is how:

```{r fig-example3, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# select the region of the time series of interest
mhw2 <- mhw$clim %>% 
  slice(10580:10690)

ggplot(mhw2, aes(x = t, y = temp, y2 = thresh)) +
  geom_flame() +
  geom_text(aes(x = as.Date("2011-02-26"), y = 25.8, label = "the Destroyer\nof Kelps"))

ggplot(mhw$event, aes(x = date_start, y = intensity_max)) +
  geom_lolli(colour = "salmon", colour_n = "red", n = 3) +
  geom_text(colour = "black", aes(x = as.Date("2006-08-01"), y = 5,
                label = "The marine heatwaves\nTend to be left skewed in a\nGiven time series"))
```

The default output of these function may not be to your liking. If so, not to worry. As **`ggplot2`** `geoms`, they are highly malleable. For example, if we were to choose to reproduce the format of the MHWs as seen in Hobday et al. (2016), the code would look something like this:

```{r fig-example4, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# It is necessary to give geom_flame() at least one row on either side of the event in order to calculate the polygon corners smoothly
mhw_top <- mhw2 %>% 
  slice(49:110)

ggplot(data = mhw2, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y = temp, y2 = thresh, fill = "all"), show.legend = T) +
  geom_flame(data = mhw_top, aes(y = temp, y2 = thresh, fill = "top"), show.legend = T) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, colour = "temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh, colour = "thresh"), size = 1.0) +
  geom_line(aes(y = seas, colour = "seas"), size = 1.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Line Colour",
                      values = c("temp" = "black", "thresh" =  "forestgreen", "seas" = "grey80")) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Event Colour", values = c("all" = "salmon", "top" = "red")) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(fill = NA))) +
  labs(y = expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")), x = NULL)
```

Should we not wish to highlight any events with `geom_lolli()`, it would look like this:

```{r fig-example5, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(mhw$event, aes(x = date_start, y = intensity_cumulative)) +
  geom_lolli(colour = "salmon")
```

The calculation and visualisation of cold-spells is also accommodated within this package. Here is a cold spell detected in the OISST data for Western Australia:

```{r detect-example2}
# First calculate the cold-spells
ts_10th <- ts2clm(sst_WA, climatologyPeriod = c("1983-01-01", "2012-12-31"), pctile = 10)
mcs <- detect_event(ts_10th, coldSpells = TRUE)

# Then look at the top few events
mcs$event %>% 
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(event_no, duration, date_start,
                date_peak, intensity_mean, intensity_max, intensity_cumulative) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(intensity_cumulative) %>% 
  head(5)
```

The plots showing the cold-spells look like this:

```{r fig-example6, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
event_line(mcs, spread = 200, metric = "intensity_cumulative",
           start_date = "1990-01-01", end_date = "1990-08-30")

lolli_plot(mcs)
```

<!-- ![](vignettes/fig-example6-1.png) -->
<!-- ![](vignettes/fig-example6-2.png) -->

Cold spell figures may be created as `geoms` in **`ggplot2`**, too:

```{r fig-example7, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mcs2 <- mcs$clim %>% 
  slice(2990:3190)

# # Note that the plot centres on the polygons, so it may be necessary to manually zoom out a bit
ggplot(data = mcs2, aes(x = t)) +
  geom_flame(aes(y = thresh, y2 = temp), fill = "steelblue3", show.legend = F) +
  geom_line(aes(y = temp, colour = "temp")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = thresh, colour = "thresh"), size = 1.0) +
  geom_line(aes(y = seas, colour = "seas"), size = 1.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Line Colour",
                      values = c("temp" = "black", "thresh" =  "forestgreen", "seas" = "grey80")) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(18, 23.5)) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  labs(y = expression(paste("Temperature [", degree, "C]")), x = NULL)

ggplot(mcs$event, aes(x = date_start, y = intensity_cumulative)) +
  geom_lolli(colour = "steelblue3", colour_n = "navy", n = 7) +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab(expression(paste("Cumulative intensity [days x ", degree, "C]")))
```
